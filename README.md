# TRAINING VISION-BASED AGENT WITH THE ACTOR CRITIC MODEL IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT
A agent for [**Slither.io**](http://slither.io/), 
which is an online game,using actor-critic algorithms.
To conquer the **uncontrollable** difficulty degree, 
dis-converge or fall into **local minima**, we propose four methods and greatly improve the performance.  
For more detail, please see our report:[**Report**](TRAINING-VISION-BASED-AGENT-WITH-THE-ACTOR-CRITIC-MODEL-IN-AN-ONLINE-ENVIRONMENT.pdf)
